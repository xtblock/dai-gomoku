Notes:
- This version aims to create a gomoku opponent for the dAI gomoku neural network training purpose.
- The developer tried to give the program freedom as much as possible while demonstrating the distributed problem solving (DPS) solution.
- This is a demo case for using XTblock's blockchain network to build a distributed AI (dAI) solution.
- There are many ideas in this program to quickly build an acceptable opponent during allow us to priotize our focus on different technology development activities.
- Feel free to help us clean the source code.
